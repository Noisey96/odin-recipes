# odin-recipes

My version of TOP's Project: Recipes. You can find the directions I followed to create the HTML [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)!

## What?

This project has four webpages, one home page and three pages of recipes. Each recipe page has an image. Lastly, each webpage is a simple HTML file linked to one CSS file.

## Why?

This project exists to show the basics of HTML, CSS, flexbox and building a website.
